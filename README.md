## Sales dashboard
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global video game sales by genre, region, and publisher. It helps identify which types of games perform best and in which markets. The dashboard helps identify regional strengths, genre-specific trends, and publisher performance. This can guide decisions in regional marketing, licensing, and portfolio planning.

### Genre icons with sales totals
At the top, clickable genre icons display total global sales in millions of units. Selecting a genre filters the entire dashboard, updating all charts.

### Sales over time by region
A bubble chart shows annual sales trends from 1980 to 2020, broken down by region. The size and color of the bubbles represent volume and region, respectively. Notably, North America saw peak sales around 2008–2010, especially in action and sports games.

### Percentage of sales by region per genre
A stacked bar chart presents how each genre's global sales are distributed across regions. This highlights regional preferences. For example, role-playing games have a higher share in Japan compared to other markets.

### Regional sales of top 10 publishers
This horizontal stacked bar chart ranks publishers by total sales and splits them by region. Nintendo leads globally, while publishers like Konami and Namco Bandai show stronger regional focus.


## Rating dashboard
This dashboard explores the relationship between game ratings (based on user reviews) and commercial success. It focuses on publishers’ performance and trends in user sentiment over time. The dashboard enables analysis of whether user ratings translates to sales success, which publishers maintain consistent quality, and how public reception trends shift over time. It supports decisions in product quality control and publisher evaluation.

### Average user score by publisher
A horizontal bar chart displays the average user score for the top publishers. Nintendo and Sony Computer Entertainment have the highest scores, suggesting strong player satisfaction with their releases. This view helps identify publishers with consistently well-received games.

### Average user score over years
A line chart shows the trend of average user scores across game release years. User sentiment peaked in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with a gradual decline afterward. This can reflect changes in game design, industry saturation, or evolving player expectations.

### Global sales vs. user score
This histogram illustrates how global sales vary with user score ratings. The chart suggests that games with scores between 8.0 and 8.5 tend to sell the most, indicating a sweet spot where both quality and market appeal align. Extremely high or low scores do not always correlate with high sales.


## Region dashboard
This dashboard breaks down video game sales performance across different geographic regions. It enables comparisons between global and regional trends and helps identify key contributors by location. It supports market segmentation strategies by identifying which regions, developers, and platforms are most influential. It can guide localized marketing, regional licensing, and inventory decisions based on platform-region fit.

### Interactive map with total regional sales
A color-coded world map shows total sales by region and year. The dropdown filter allows switching between regions (e.g., Japan, North America, Europe). Circle sizes and colors highlight regional volumes, with North America and Europe showing the highest totals.

### Global vs. regional sales over time
A dual-line chart displays trends in both global and selected regional sales over time. Global sales peaked between 2005 and 2010, while regional sales also followed similar patterns but at lower volumes.

### Top developers by regional sales
A treemap ranks the top 10 game developers by total sales in the selected region. In general, Nintendo dominates, with other notable developers like Square Enix, Capcom, and Konami appearing based on the chosen market. The color intensity reflects sales volume.

### Global vs. regional sales by platform
A horizontal bar chart compares sales on various platforms (e.g., PS2, Wii, DS) across global and regional figures. This helps determine which platforms are more regionally successful.
