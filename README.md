### Genre icons with sales totals
At the top, clickable genre icons display total global sales in millions of units. Selecting a genre filters the entire dashboard, updating all charts.

### Sales over time by region
A bubble chart shows annual sales trends from 1980 to 2020, broken down by region. The size and color of the bubbles represent volume and region, respectively. Notably, North America saw peak sales around 2008–2010, especially in action and sports games.

### Percentage of sales by region per genre
A stacked bar chart presents how each genre's global sales are distributed across regions. This highlights regional preferences. For example, role-playing games have a higher share in Japan compared to other markets.

### Regional sales of top 10 publishers
This horizontal stacked bar chart ranks publishers by total sales and splits them by region. Nintendo leads globally, while publishers like Konami and Namco Bandai show stronger regional focus.


## Rating dashboard
This dashboard explores the relationship between game ratings (based on user reviews) and commercial success. It focuses on publishers’ performance and trends in user sentiment over time. The dashboard enables analysis of whether user ratings translates to sales success, which publishers maintain consistent quality, and how public reception trends shift over time. It supports decisions in product quality control and publisher evaluation.

### Average user score by publisher
A horizontal bar chart displays the average user score for the top publishers. Nintendo and Sony Computer Entertainment have the highest scores, suggesting strong player satisfaction with their releases. This view helps identify publishers with consistently well-received games.

### Average user score over years
A line chart shows the trend of average user scores across game release years. User sentiment peaked in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with a gradual decline afterward. This can reflect changes in game design, industry saturation, or evolving player expectations.

### Global sales vs. user score
This histogram illustrates how global sales vary with user score ratings. The chart suggests that games with scores between 8.0 and 8.5 tend to sell the most, indicating a sweet spot where both quality and market appeal align. Extremely high or low scores do not always correlate with high sales.
